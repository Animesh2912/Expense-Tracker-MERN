# Expense-Tracker-MERN
The Expense Tracker App is a full-stack application built with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to manage expenses, with a back-end for data storage and authentication, and a React front-end for an interactive UI. Axios is used for seamless data integration.
